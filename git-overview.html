    <h2 id="what-is-git">What is Git?</h2>
    <p>
      Git is a distributed version control software. Version control is a way to
      save changes over time without overwriting previous versions. Being
      distributed means that every developer working with a Git repository has a
      copy of that entire repository - every commit, every branch, every file.
      If you’re used to working with centralized version control systems, this
      is a big difference!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not you’ve worked with version control before, there are a few
      things you should know before getting started with Git:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Branches are lightweight and cheap, so it’s OK to have many of them
      </li>
      <li>
        Git stores changes in SHA hashes, which work by compressing text files.
        That makes Git a very good version control system (VCS) for software
        programming, but not so good for binary files like images or videos.
      </li>
      <li>
        Git repositories can be connected, so you can work on one locally on
        your own machine, and connect it to a shared repository. This way, you
        can <a href="/git-guides/git-push">push</a> and
        <a href="/git-guides/git-pull">pull</a> changes to a repository and
        easily collaborate with others.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-git-written-in">What is Git Written in?</h2>
    <p>
      The tools that make up the core Git distribution are written in C, Shell,
      Perl, and Tcl. You can find Git’s source code on GitHub under
      <a href="https://github.com/git/git">git/git</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-use-git">Why Use Git?</h2>
    <p>
      Version control is very important - without it, you risk losing your work.
      With Git, you can make a “commit”, or a save point, as often as you’d
      like. You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure
      off of you while you’re working. Commit often and commit early, and you’ll
      never have that gut-sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many version control systems out there - but Git has some major
      advantages.
    </p>
    <h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
    <p>
      Like we mentioned above, Git uses SHA compression, which makes it very
      fast.
    </p>
    <h3 id="merge-conflicts">Merge conflicts</h3>
    <p>
      Git can handle merge conflicts, which means that
      <strong
        >it’s OK for multiple people to work on the same file at the same
        time</strong
      >. This opens up the world of development in a way that isn’t possible
      with centralized version control. You have access to the entire project,
      and if you’re working on a branch, you can do whatever you need to and
      know that your changes are safe.
    </p>
    <h3 id="cheap-branches">Cheap branches</h3>
    <p>
      Speaking of branches, Git offers a lot of flexibility and opportunity for
      collaboration with branches.
      <strong
        >By using branches, developers can make changes in a safe
        sandbox.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of only committing code that is 100% sure to succeed, developers
      can commit code that might still need help. Then, they can push that code
      to the remote and get fast feedback from integrated tests or peer review.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without sharing the code through branches, this would never be possible.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ease-of-roll-back">Ease of roll back</h3>
    <p>
      If you make a mistake, it’s OK! Commits are immutable, meaning they can’t
      be changed. (<em
        >Note: You <em>can</em> change history, but it will create new
        replacement commits instead of editing the existing commits. More on
        that later!</em
      >) This means that if you do make a mistake, even on an important branch,
      like <code>main</code>, it’s <em>OK</em>.
      <strong
        >You can easily revert that change, or roll back the branch pointer to
        the commit where everything was fine.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefits of this can’t be overstated. Not only does it create a safer
      environment for the project and code, but it fosters a development
      environment where developers can be braver, trusting that Git has their
      back.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-use-git">How Do I Use Git?</h2>
    <h3 id="learning-git-basics">Learning Git Basics</h3>
    <p>
      If you’re getting started with Git, a great place to learn the basic
      commands is the
      <a href="https://github.github.io/training-kit/">Git Cheat sheet</a>. It’s
      translated into many languages,
      <a href="https://github.com/github/training-kit"
        >open source as a part of the
        <code>github/training-kit</code> repository</a
      >, and a great starting place for the fundamentals on the command line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the most important and most used commands that you’ll find there
      are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>git clone [url]</code>:
        <a href="/git-guides/git-clone">Clone</a> (download) a repository that
        already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and
        commits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git status</code>: Always a good idea, this command shows you what
        branch you’re on, what files are in the working or staging directory,
        and any other important information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git branch</code>: This shows the existing branches in your local
        repository. You can also use <code>git branch [branch-name]</code> to
        create a branch from your current location, or
        <code>git branch --all</code> to see all branches, both the local ones
        on your machine, and the remote tracking branches stored from the last
        <code>git pull</code> or <code>git fetch</code> from the remote.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git checkout [branch-name]</code>: Switches to the specified
        branch and updates the working directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git add [file]</code>: Snapshots the file in preparation for
        versioning, adding it to the staging area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git commit -m "descriptive message"</code>: Records file snapshots
        permanently in the version history.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git pull</code>: Updates your current local working branch with
        all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub.
        <code>git pull</code> is a combination of <code>git fetch</code> and
        <code>git merge</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git push</code>: Uploads all local branch commits to the remote.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git log</code>: Browse and inspect the evolution of project files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>git remote -v</code>: Show the associated remote repositories and
        their stored name, like <code>origin</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="getting-started-with-the-git-workflow">
      Getting Started With the Git Workflow
    </h3>
    <p>
      Depending on your operating system, you may already have
      <a href="/git-guides/install-git">Git installed</a>. But, getting started
      means more than having the software! To get started, it’s important to
      know the basics of how Git works. You may choose to do the actual work
      within a terminal, an app like GitHub Desktop, or through GitHub.com. (<em
        >Note: while you can interact with Git through GitHub.com, your
        experience may be limited. Many local tools can give you access to the
        most widely used Git functionalities, though only the terminal will give
        you access to them all.</em
      >)
    </p>
    <p>
      There are <em>many</em> ways to use Git, which doesn’t necessarily make it
      easier! But, the fundamental Git workflow has a few main steps. You can
      practice all of these in the
      <a href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github"
        >Introduction to GitHub Learning Lab course</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h4 id="create-a-branch">Create a branch</h4>
    <p>
      The main branch is usually called <code>main</code>. We want to work on
      <em>another</em> branch, so we can make a pull request and make changes
      safely. To get started, create a branch off of <code>main</code>. Name it
      however you’d like - but we recommend naming branches based on the
      function or feature that will be the focus of this branch. One person may
      have several branches, and one branch may have several people collaborate
      on it - branches are for a purpose, not a person. Wherever you currently
      “are” (wherever HEAD is pointing, or whatever branch you’re currently
      “checked out” to) will be the parent of the branch you create. That means
      you can create branches from other branches, tags, or any commit! But, the
      most typical workflow is to create a branch from <code>main</code> - which
      represents the most current production code.
    </p>
    <h4 id="make-changes-and-make-a-commit">
      Make changes (and make a commit)
    </h4>
    <p>
      Once you’ve created a branch, and moved the HEAD pointer to it by
      “checking out” to that branch, you’re ready to get to work. Make the
      changes in your repository using your favorite text editor or IDE.
    </p>
    <p>Next, save your changes. You’re ready to start the commit!</p>
    <p>
      To start your <a href="/git-guides/git-commit">commit</a>, you need to let
      Git know what changes you’d like to include with
      <code>git add [file]</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’ve saved and staged the changes, you’re ready to
      <a href="/git-guides/git-commit">make the commit</a> with
      <code>git commit -m "descriptive commit message"</code>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="push-your-changes-to-the-remote">
      Push your changes to the remote
    </h4>
    <p>
      So far, if you’ve made a commit locally, you’re the only one that can see
      it. To let others see your work and begin collaboration, you should “push”
      your changes using <code>git push</code>. If you’re pushing from a branch
      for the first time that you’ve created locally, you may need to give Git
      some more information. <code>git push -u origin [branch-name]</code> tells
      Git to push the current branch, and create a branch on the remote that
      matches it with the same name - and also, create a relationship with that
      branch so that <code>git push</code> will be enough information in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, <code>git push</code> only pushes the branch that you’ve
      currently checked out to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, if there has been a new commit on the branch on the
      <em>remote</em>, you may be blocked from pushing. Don’t worry! Start with
      a simple <a href="/git-guides/git-pull"><code>git pull</code></a> to
      incorporate the changes on the remote into your own local branch, resolve
      any conflicts or finish the merge from the remote into the local branch,
      and then try the push again.
    </p>
    <h4 id="open-a-pull-request">Open a pull request</h4>
    <p>
      Pushing a branch, or new commits, to a remote repository is enough if a
      pull request already exists, but if it’s the first time you’re pushing
      that branch, you should open a new pull request. A pull request is a
      comparison of two branches - typically <code>main</code>, or the branch
      that the feature branch was created from, and the feature branch. This
      way, like branches, pull requests are scoped around a specific function or
      addition of work, rather than the person making the changes or the amount
      of time the changes will take.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pull requests are the powerhouse of GitHub. Integrated tests can
      automatically run on pull requests, giving you immediate feedback on your
      code. Peers can give detailed code reviews, letting you know if there are
      changes to make, or if it’s ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure you start your pull requests off with the right information. Put
      yourself in the shoes of your teammates, or even of your future self.
      Include information about what this change relates to, what prompted it,
      what is already done, what is left to do, and any specific asks for help
      or reviews. Include links to relevant work or conversations. Pull request
      templates can help make this process easy by automating the starting
      content of the body of pull requests.
    </p>
    <h4 id="collaborate">Collaborate</h4>
    <p>
      Once the pull request is open, then the real fun starts. It’s important to
      recognize that pull requests aren’t meant to be open when work is
      <em>finished</em>. Pull requests should be open when work is
      <em>beginning</em>! The earlier you open a pull request, the more
      visibility the entire team has to the work that you’re doing. When you’re
      ready for feedback, you can get it by integrating tests or requesting
      reviews from teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s very likely that you will want to make more changes to your work.
      That’s great! To do that, make more commits on the same branch. Once the
      new commits are present on the remote, the pull request will update and
      show the most recent version of your work.
    </p>
    <h4 id="merge-into-main">Merge into <code>main</code></h4>
    <p>
      Once you and your team decide that the pull request looks good, you can
      merge it. By merging, you integrate the feature branch into the other
      branch (most typically the <code>main</code> branch). Then,
      <code>main</code> will be updated with your changes, and your pull request
      will be closed. Don’t forget to delete your branch! You won’t need it
      anymore. Remember, branches are lightweight and cheap, and you should
      create a new one when you need it based on the most recent commit on the
      <code>main</code> branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose not to merge the pull request, you can also close pull
      requests with unmerged changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re wondering where Git ends and GitHub begins, you’re not alone.
      They are tied closely together to make working with them both a seamless
      experience. While Git takes care of the underlying version control, GitHub
      is the collaboration platform built on top of it. GitHub is the place for
      pull requests, comments, reviews, integrated tests, and so much more. Most
      developers work locally to develop and use GitHub for collaboration. That
      ranges from using GitHub to host the shared remote repository to working
      with colleagues and capitalizing on features like protected branches, code
      review, GitHub Actions, and more.
